<h2>Early Childhood:</h2>
<p>
Tam was borned in Hong Kong, China, by the time she born Hong Kong was still in British's control. Which might have put some impacts on her causing her to emigrate to Uk when she was young. She attended the University of Nottingham in UK before she went to Canada. She earned a BMBS, which is the medical degree in UK. After that she went to Canada to finish her study of pedistric and infectious disease. When she came to Uk she attended an all-girl school and she started showing her interests and talents in science and biology. In UK her biology teacher, Mrs. Bradley, started paying attention to her and helped her with her study. After she finished her university in Uk and got a medical degree she came to Canada and went to University of Alberta and University of British Columbia to finish her study in pedistric and infectious diseases.

<h2>Career:</h2>
<p>
After she graduated from Uk and came to Canada she started looking for a job. At first she wasn't interested in high-porfit agent of public health. Instead, she hoped to become a general surgeon. As she explained later, the agent of public health required a three year undergraduate degree, alone with a two-year pre-residency internship. However, the acceptance rate for a surgeon is low, especially for a foreign student, so she applied for pediatric instead and she was fortunate to be accepted by the University of Alberta.
